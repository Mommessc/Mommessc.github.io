### Bio

Hi there!

I'm Clément Mommessin, and I am currently doing a post-doc in the University of Leeds to work on scheduling for large-scale distributed systems.
I'm mainly working on scheduling and simulation, applied to platforms such as parallel and distributed machines in the HPC (High Performance Computing) or Cloud/Edge Computing domains.


I graduated as a Ph.D. in computer science in December 2020 (that's pretty new!), for which I worked under the supervision of Denis Trystram and Giorgio Lucarelli, in the DATAMOVE team of the Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, in... Grenoble (oh really!?).
Here are my [manuscript](/files/thesis/thesis_mommessin_final.pdf) and [presentation](/files/thesis/soutenance_mommessin.pdf).

Between my Masters' and the beginning of my Ph.D. I did an internship in the MCS division of the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago under the supervision of Matthieu Dreher, Tom Peterka and Bruno Raffin.
I worked on the [Decaf project](https://bitbucket.org/tpeterka1/decaf/src/master/) in the development of an automatic dataflows filtering mechanism for in situ HPC workflows.
Here are the [published paper](/files/decaf/contract_paper.pdf) of this work as well as the [presentation slides](/files/decaf/presentation.pdf) for the team.

During my Masters Degree, I worked on *Scheduling Parallel Programs on Hybrid Machines*.
Here are my [thesis report](/files/M2/report_M2_mommessin.pdf) and [slides](/files/M2/slides_M2_mommessin.pdf).


If you mant more formal details about me, here's my [curriculum](/files/CV_mommessin_aug_2022.pdf).





### Hobbies

On my free time, I'm mostly reading novels, cycling, dancing and solving puzzles, or preparing new scientific mediation activities.  
Overall, I'm simply living!





### Projects

Here are some of the projects I work(ed) on.

On my everyday work in research I use and make contributions to [Batsim](https://github.com/oar-team/batsim), an infrastructure simulator for jobs and I/O scheduling, built on top of the simulation toolkit [SimGrid](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/).


On a funnier point of view, I'm working on mediation activities for mathematics and computer science.  
Together with Marie Le Guilly we created our own mediation activity named [Mesures Binaires](https://github.com/Mommessc/Mesures_binaires-binaires), during the summer school "Médiation Scientifique en Informatique" organised by the SIF in Toulouse in June 2018.


I am also implementing small board games such as [Katarenga](https://github.com/Henry38/Katarenga) or the (not famous enough) [Hex](https://github.com/Mommessc/Hex).
