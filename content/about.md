### Bio

Hi there!

I'm Clément Mommessin, a Ph.D. student in computer science under the supervision of Denis Trystram and Giorgio Lucarelli, in the DATAMOVE team of the Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, in... Grenoble (oh really!?).  
I'm mainly working on scheduling and simulation, applied to platforms such as parallel machines in the HPC (High Performance Computing) or distributed in some Cloud/Edge fashion.

Between my Masters' and the beginning of my Ph.D. I did an internship in the MCS division of the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago under the supervision of Matthieu Dreher, Tom Peterka and Bruno Raffin.
I worked on the [Decaf project](https://bitbucket.org/tpeterka1/decaf/src/master/) in the development of an automatic dataflows filtering mechanism for in situ HPC workflows.
Here are the [published paper](/files/decaf/contract_paper.pdf) of this work as well as the [presentation slides](/files/decaf/presentation.pdf) for the team.

During my Masters Degree, I worked on *Scheduling Parallel Programs on Hybrid Machines*.
Here are my [thesis report](/files/M2/report_M2_mommessin.pdf) and [slides](/files/M2/slides_M2_mommessin.pdf).


If you mant more formal details about me, here's my [curriculum](/files/resume_mommessin_2020.pdf).





### Hobbies

On my free time, I'm mostly reading novels, cylcling, dancing and solving puzzles, or preparing new scientific mediation activities.  
Overall, I'm simply living!





### Projects

Here are some of the projects I work(ed) on.

On my everyday work in research I use and make contributions to [Batsim](https://github.com/oar-team/batsim), an infrastructure simulator for jobs and I/O scheduling, build on top of the simulation toolkit [SimGrid](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/).


On a funnier point of view, I'm working on mediation activities for mathematics and computer science.  
Together with Marie Le Guilly we created our own mediation activity named [Mesures Binaires](https://github.com/Mommessc/Mesures_binaires-binaires), during the summer school "Médiation Scientifique en Informatique" organised by the SIF in Toulouse in June 2018.


I am also implementing small board games such as [Katarenga](https://github.com/Henry38/Katarenga) or the [Hex](https://github.com/Mommessc/Hex).
