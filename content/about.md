### Bio

Hey there!

I'm Clément Mommessin, and I am currently doing a post-doc in the Stack team of IMT Atlantique in Nantes.
Before that, I did a first post doc at the University of Leeds, working on scheduling for large-scale distributed systems.
I'm mainly working on scheduling and simulation, applied to platforms such as parallel and distributed machines in the HPC (High Performance Computing) or Cloud/Edge Computing domains.


I graduated as a Ph.D. in computer science in December 2020 (that's pretty new!), for which I worked under the supervision of Denis Trystram and Giorgio Lucarelli, in the DATAMOVE team of the Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, in... Grenoble (oh really!?).
The manuscript is available [online](https://www.theses.fr/2020GRALM065) and the presentation is [here](/files/soutenance_thesis.pdf).

Between my Masters' and the beginning of my Ph.D. I did an internship in the MCS division of the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago under the supervision of Matthieu Dreher, Tom Peterka and Bruno Raffin.
I worked on the [Decaf project](https://bitbucket.org/tpeterka1/decaf/src/master/) in the development of an automatic dataflows filtering mechanism for in situ HPC workflows.
Here are the [published paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01581032) of this work and the [presentation slides](/files/decaf_presentation.pdf) for the team.

During my Masters Degree, I worked on *Scheduling Parallel Programs on Hybrid Machines*.
Here are my [thesis report](/files/M2/report_M2_mommessin.pdf) and [slides](/files/M2/slides_M2_mommessin.pdf).


If you mant more formal details about me, here's my [curriculum](/files/CV_mommessin_feb_2023.pdf).





### Hobbies

On my free time, I'm mostly reading novels, cycling, dancing and solving puzzles, or preparing new scientific mediation activities.  
Overall, I'm simply living!





### Projects

Here are some of the projects I work(ed) on.

On my everyday work in research I use and make contributions to [Batsim](https://github.com/oar-team/batsim), an infrastructure simulator for jobs and I/O scheduling, built on top of the simulation toolkit [SimGrid](https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid).

During my post-doc position at the University of Leeds, I developed a [C++ library for the Vector Bin Packing problem](https://github.com/Vectorpack/Vectorpack_cpp)), along with multiple algorithms to solve such a problem.
This library is intended to be used by everyone who wants to play with the (Vector) Bin Packing Problem and implement packing algorithms. If you are interested or have contributions to bring to this project, please come and contact me!

On a funnier point of view, I'm working on mediation activities for mathematics and computer science.  
Together with Marie Le Guilly we created our own mediation activity named [Mesures Binaires](https://github.com/Mommessc/Mesures_binaires), during the summer school "Médiation Scientifique en Informatique" organised by the SIF in Toulouse in June 2018.


I am also implementing small board games such as [Katarenga](https://github.com/Henry38/Katarenga) or the (unfortunately not famous enough) [Hex](https://github.com/Mommessc/Hex)!
