Teaching
========

## 2023

During my second post-doc, I did practical sessions for the *Algorithmics and Discreet Maths with Python* module of first year students at the IMT Atlantique engineering school in Nantes.


## 2021, 2022

During my first post-doc, I taught tutorials for the *Combinatorial Optimisation* and *Algorithmic* modules for Undergratuate students at the University of Leeds.


## 2019, 2020

In my second and third year of Ph.D I taught for the *Computer Architecture and Assembly* class of first year students at IUT2 of Grenoble.
It consisted in exercises and practical work in assembly code.
Throughout the class, students had to write functions for a *ball-and-paddle* game.

I also gave lectures, tutorials and practical works for the *Data Structures and Fundamental Algorithms* class of first year students at IUT2 of Grenoble.
The programming language used in this module was ADA.


## 2017, 2018

In my first two years of Ph.D. I taught for the *Algorithmic and Programming* class of first year students at IUT1 in Grenoble.
It consisted in the first part of exercises for basics algorithmic and practical work with the PHP programming language.

I also gave tutorials and practical works for the subsequent class of *Algorithmic and Web Development* which extended the first class with data structures, sorting algorithms and object-oriented programming and databases (still in PHP).
At the end of this class, groups of students had to design and develop a simple website with dynamic content and read/writes in an associated database.




Student Supervision
====================

During my Ph.D. I co-supervised 3 students, Ning Tang, Aleksandr Danilin and Mohammed Almarakby, for Mater's first year internship on various subjects related to my research work in the domain of Edge Computing and most specifically applied to the *Qarnot Computing* platform.

I also co-supervised Anderson Andrei Da Silva for his Master's final project, whose subject is closely related to our scientific paper published in the [SBAC-PAD 2020](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02915346) conference.
