### Teaching

## 2019

In my second and third year of Ph.D I taught for the *Computer Architecture and Assembly* class of first year students at IUT2 of Grenoble.
It consisted in exercises and practical work in assembly code.
Throughout the class, students had to write functions for a *ball-and-paddle* game.

I also gave lectures, tutorials and practical works for the *Data Structures and Fundamental Algorithms* class of first year students at IUT2 of Grenoble.
The programming language used in practical works was ADA.



## 2017, 2018

In my first two years of Ph.D. I taught for the *Algorithmic and Programming* class of first year students at IUT1 in Grenoble.
It consisted in the first part of exercises for basics algorithmic and practical work with the PHP programming language.

I also gave tutorials and practical works for the subsequent class of *Algorithmic and Web Development* which extended the first class with data structures, sorting algorithms and object-oriented programming and databases (still in PHP).
At the end of this class, groups of students had to design and develop a simple website with dynamic content and read/writes in an associated database.
